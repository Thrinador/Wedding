## Registry

At this point in our lives, we are not looking for things to fill our home with. We would prefer monetary donations to help cover college and living expenses.

Here are some ways that we can accept money:

* cash
* check made out to Ben Clark or Polina Eremenko
* Venmo payment to @Polina-Eremenko
* The foundation for support and relief of pain and debt caused by the greedy college institution

If cash is not your thing, here is a list of places that we would appreciate gift cards to:

* Fred Meyer
* QFC
* Bed Bath and Beyond
* Etsy
* Michaels
* Steam
* Frys Electronics
* Target
* Amazon
* Ebay
